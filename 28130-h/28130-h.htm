</div><div class='unindent'><br />BOUT a year ago, Edwin had a Christmas present
of a jig-saw. If Santa Claus brought it, then
Santa Claus did a good thing for himself; for
last Christmas his pack was loaded down with
presents of Edwin's manufacture.</div>

<p>Nice little brackets to set up against the wall, nice little
bedsteads, book-shelves, toy-houses, frames for pictures,
card-baskets,&mdash;these are but a few of the great variety of
things that Edwin makes with his jig-saw.</p>

<p>Many little articles he gives away, for he is a generous
boy: but he wants books, and his mother cannot always
afford to buy him the books he wants; for she has two
children, besides himself, to provide for.</p>

<p>So one day when Mr. Topliff, who keeps a great toy-shop,
said to Edwin, "I'll pay you well for as many of these toy-houses
as you can make," Edwin replied, "I'll go to work
just as soon as I have finished this bracket; for a little
money is just what I want."</p>

<p>Edwin had by practice learned to use his saw with great
skill, and he took pains always to do his work well. Gradually
he learned to do the finer sort of cabinet-work; and
then he puzzled his wits to invent new varieties of toys,
and other things often sought for as Christmas presents.</p>

<p>Mr. Topliff said, "You can earn a living by this kind of
work, if you choose, Edwin." But no! Edwin had made
up his mind to go to college; and so he replied, "If I can
pay my college expenses by working at odd hours, Mr.
Topliff, I mean to do it&mdash;and I think I can."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Mr. Topliff. "You've got the knack.
Well, my lad, don't forget the firm of Topliff &amp; Co. Bring
us all your pretty things."</p>

<h2>THE PETITION OF THE SPARROWS.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Now</span> girls and boys of Chester Square,<br />
Pray give us of your meals a share.<br />
Just have the kindness to remember<br />
That this is chilly, bleak December;<br />
That snow has covered long the ground<br />
Till really nothing's to be found:<br />
So throw us out a crumb or two,<br />
And, as you would be done by, do.<br />
<br />
In those snug little cottages<br />
That you have placed among the trees,<br />
We all were hatched, and so, you see,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Are members of the family.<br />
Hunger and frost are hard to bear:<br />
So, girls and boys of Chester Square,<br />
Just throw us out a crumb or two,<br />
And, as you would be done by, do.<br />
<br />
We know bad things of us are told:<br />
They call us English upstarts bold;<br />
Say we drive off the snow-birds dear,<br />
And fight the Yankee sparrows here;<br />
That we make havoc in the spring<br />
With all the sweet-pea's blossoming:<br />
Still throw us out a crumb or two,<br />
And, as you would be done by, do.<br />
<br />
We're not as bad as they declare,<br />
O girls and boys of Chester Square!<br />
Be sure some little good we do,<br />
Even though we pilfer buds a few.<br />
Don't grudge them, since your trees we clear<br />
Of vermin that would cost you dear:<br />
So throw us out a crumb or two,<br />
And, as you would be done by, do.<br />
<br />
Dear girls and boys of Chester Square,<br />
We, too, partake the Father's care;<br />
And to your kindly hearts he sends<br />
The impulse that our race befriends:<br />
We know that you, while Winter reigns,<br />
For our relief will take some pains;<br />
Will throw us out a crumb or two,<br />
And, as you would be done by, do.<br />
And, as you would be done by, do.<br />

<h2>MY DOG JACK.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I want</span> to tell the readers of "The Nursery" about my
dog. My mamma bought him for me when he was very
young. He is a Newfoundland dog, and is very large. He
is black, with a white face and neck. His name is Jack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack is very useful in keeping tramps out of our orchard,
and is also very kind and playful. I do not like to play
with him; for he is so rough, that he sometimes tumbles me
over, and hurts me: but I have a good time with him in
other ways.</p>

<p>He draws me about in a little cart into which I harness
him. He minds a pull on the reins, and will go just as I
wish him to. But he will insist on chasing pigs whenever
he sees them. He does not like pigs.</p>

<p>One day, when I was harnessing him, he spied a pig,
and away he ran after it&mdash;cart and all. He broke one
wheel of the cart, and came back panting and wagging his
tail, as if he had done something good; but I scolded him
well.</p>

<p>Jack will sit on his hind-legs, and catch bits of bread or
cake in his mouth when I throw them to him. One summer,
we went to the seashore, and took him with us. He is a
splendid swimmer; and when we took a stick, and threw it
into the water, he would plunge through the waves, and
bring it back in his mouth.</p>

<p>Sometimes an old fisherman took me out sailing, and as
there was not room in the boat for Jack, the good old dog
would lie on the wharf and wait patiently till I came back.
When he saw the boat coming in, he would jump up and
bark in great delight; and one day he leaped into the water,
and swam out to meet us.</p>

<p>Once my cousin and I were sitting in a cleft in the rocks,
gathering shells and pebbles, when a great black creature
jumped right over our heads. We were much frightened,
but soon found that it was only our good friend Jack. He
had seen us from the top of the rock, and had jumped down
full fifteen feet to get to us.</p>

<h2>BERTIE'S STEAMER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertie</span> has taken much pleasure in hearing me read about
the different ways in which the little "Nursery" people
amuse themselves. He is very anxious that they should, in
return, know about the steamboat which his uncle brought
him from the Centennial,&mdash;a <i>real</i> little steamboat.</p>

<p>It is nearly a foot long, made of brass, with a "truly"
boiler, as Bertie says, and a little alcohol lamp to convert
the water in the boiler into steam.</p>

<p>The older folks were as much interested in its trial trip as
Bertie. The biggest tub was brought up, and half filled
with water. The little boiler was also filled, and the lamp
lighted; and we all waited patiently for the steam to start
the little wheel. A stick was put across the tub, and a
string fastened from its centre to the end of the steamer, to
keep it from running against the side of the tub. The
rudder was turned to guide the boat in a circle, and soon the
steamer started.</p>

<p>But it did not run easily. Could it be that it would prove
a failure? Bertie's face began to put on a disappointed
look.</p>

<p>"Can't Uncle Nelson fix it?" said he. "Uncle Nelson
can do most any thing."</p>

<p>So Uncle Nelson took the delicate machinery apart, and
found some particles of dirt, which prevented the piston from
working smoothly. Then he cleaned and oiled it, put it
together again, and once more it started. This time it was
a complete success. How Bertie clapped his hands, as the
steam hissed, and the boat went round and round, as if it
were alive!</p>

<p>It was half an hour before the water in the little boiler
gave out.</p>

<h2>A STORY ABOUT SQUIRRELS.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/illus041.png" width="203" height="500" alt="Squirrels" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Freddie</span> is a bright little
boy six years old. He
goes with his papa and
mamma every summer to
stay a few months at a
nice place in the country.
In front of the house, near
the fence, stands a large
elm-tree, which is the home
of many little squirrels.</p>


<p>One day Freddie got his
papa to build him a small
shelf on the tree, about
four feet from the ground,
so that he could put nuts
on it to feed the squirrels.
At first the little fellows
were very shy, and would
not come near the shelf,
but sat on the branches of
the tree; and we fancied
that we heard them saying
to each other, "Do
you think that little boy
would hurt us, if we should
run down, and take one of
those nuts?"</p>

<p>But, after a while, they
came down, one by one,
took the nuts, and went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
scampering up to the top branches; and in a few minutes
down came the empty shells. They grew so tame before
the summer was over, that if we put any thing on their
shelf, and took a seat a few steps away, they would come
down quite boldly, and get their breakfast.</p>

<p>One day we put a small ear of sweet-corn on the shelf.
Pretty soon a little squirrel came after it; but it was too
heavy for him: so he sat down on the shelf, as though quite
at home, ate off about half of the kernels of corn, to make
his burden lighter, and, after trying many times, finally got
it up to his hiding-place. Presently we saw all the squirrels
running to that part of the tree, and we thought he might
be having a squirrel-party in his best parlor.</p>

<p>There was a large pond not very far away; and we often
saw the squirrels go from tree to tree, jump a fence here
and there, and run down behind a stone wall to the pond to
get a drink, and then run home again. If they had only
known as much as some squirrels we read about, what a
nice sail they might have had by jumping on a piece of
wood, and putting their bushy tails up in the air for a sail!
Wouldn't it look funny to see a squirrel yacht-race?</p>

<p>As we sit in our warm rooms this cold weather, we often
wonder what the little fellows are doing, and if they are
eating any of the nuts they stored away last summer.</p>

<h2>WHAT A LITTLE BOY IN ENGLAND SAYS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> grandfather and grandmother live in the country.
Everybody in their house is very fond of birds, and very
thoughtful for the comfort of all dumb creatures.</p>

<p>Among the birds that flock about grandfather's house are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the bright little tom-tits. They fly very quickly, and look
very pretty, darting in and out of a tall evergreen-tree that
grows in front of the dining-room window.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 232px;">
<img src="images/illus043.png" width="232" height="300" alt="Tom-tits" title="" />
</div>

<p>In winter, my Aunt Emily has a pole, about four feet
high, stuck in the ground near this tree. Across the top of
the pole, a light bamboo stick is fastened, not quite as long
as the pole is high. On strings tied at the ends of the
bamboo stick, netted bags, filled with fat or suet, are hung.</p>

<p>Now, tom-tits are, I think, the only birds in England that
can cling to a thing with their heads hanging down; and
they are very fond of fat. So they come to aunty's bags,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cling to them as they sway to and fro in the wind, and eat
to their little hearts' content. We watch them from the
windows, and see what is going on.</p>

<p>Sometimes other birds try very hard to get a share of the
feast, particularly when the weather is very cold, and they
cannot find much else. Then they will stand on the ground,
looking at the bags, and now and then make an awkward
spring at them, sometimes snatching a piece of suet, but
generally failing to reach it.</p>

<p>A tiny robin (an English robin is not at all like an
American one) has practised so much, this cold weather,
that he can not only get a taste of the suet by darting at it,
but, better still, will sit on the top of the bag, and get at
it in that way. But he seems very much afraid of falling
off, and I think the tom-tits would laugh at him: perhaps
they do, in bird fashion.</p>

<p>When they cling, they do not mind where it is, and often
seem to take the very bottom of the bag by choice, and
hang there, with their heads down, so long, that it seems as
though they would surely get the headache.</p>

<p>I have often seen two, and sometimes three birds on a
bag at a time.</p>

<h2>FIRST LESSON IN ASTRONOMY.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star:<br />
How I wonder what you are,<br />
Up above the world so high,<br />
Like a diamond in the sky!"<br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> going to tell all the wondering children just what
that little star is, and I want them to go to the window this
minute, and take a good look at it.</p>

<p>Have you been? And was it "up above the world so
high"? Some of you are laughing at me, perhaps, because
it is broad daylight, when stars do not show themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
But do not laugh yet. If the sun is out, you can certainly
see a star.</p>

<p>To be sure you cannot take a good look at it, it is so
bright; but there it is,&mdash;the star that gives us light and
heat,&mdash;the sun himself. Now, were you ever told before,
that the sun is a star, just like the little diamonds you see
in the sky before you go to bed?</p>

<p>Why shouldn't it look like a star then? Because it is not
"up above the world so high" as all the rest of the stars
are. It is near enough to us to keep us warm, and make
every thing grow.</p>

<p>But what is more wonderful than that our sun is a star, is,
that all the stars are suns. They keep the worlds that are
near them warm and bright, just as our sun does this world.
They are great globes of fire that never go out.</p>

<p>Some are red fire, some are blue, some yellow, and some
white, like ours. How should you like to have it all red, or
blue, or green, out doors, instead of white? It would seem
a good deal like fireworks to us, I think.</p>

<p>Now look out of the window again, and try to pick out a
red star. I know one you can all see before you go to bed,
unless you are too sleepy to see any thing. It is nearly overhead
about supper-time. If you find it, write a little letter
to "The Nursery," and tell me.</p>

<h2>PAPA'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> is a little boy six years old. He always wants to
be doing something; and many funny pictures he makes,
both on his slate and with a lead pencil on paper. Mamma
saves all the blank pieces of paper she can to give him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
When he is tired of pictures, he plays with his blocks,
and makes boats, and cars and bridges, and towers and
churches.</p>

<p>Harry lives on the west bank of the Mississippi River,
where there is a bridge right in sight from his home. He
often watches the cars go across the bridge, and the boats
go through the draw. He is an observing little fellow,
and he notices that just before the cars get to the bridge
they stop, and then go over very slowly. Then they start
up faster and faster; and soon the bridge is left behind, and
the cars are out of sight.</p>

<p>The cars always have to wait for the boats to go through
the bridge; and Harry thinks that is too bad; for the cars
would not keep the boats waiting half as long as the boats
keep them. So mamma tells him that the river was there
first, and the boats have the first right.</p>

<p>But about the present. There had been a week of rain;
but papa's birthday was pleasant, and Harry was glad to
get out of doors. He ran till he was tired, and then, as he
sat down to rest, he thought he would get some clay, and
make something to show mamma.</p>

<p>So he began. First he made a round ball like a marble,
then a larger ball; then he put them together, and thought,
"I will make a man, and this little ball shall be his head."
He put a stick in to hold the head to the body, and put clay
around the stick, and that made the neck. Then he made
a long piece for the legs, and cut out between them with a
knife to form two. Then he made the arms, and joined them
to the body.</p>

<p>He was very much pleased with his work so far; but to
complete it was the most fun. He got little stones, and
stuck them into the clay for eyes, nose, and buttons; made
a cut for the mouth; and, for a head-dress, made use of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
green spikes from a pine-tree. This made the figure look
so much like an Indian, that Harry danced with joy.</p>

<p>Then he took it to mamma, who was so pleased that she
told him to put it on papa's study-table to dry, and said that
it would do for papa's birthday present.</p>

<p>Papa thinks so much of it, that he has locked it up in
his curiosity cabinet. This is a true story.</p>

<h2>THE RESCUE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span> is a bright little girl, about six years old, who lives
not far from a wharf in a seaport town, where her father is
employed in a junk store. She has an elder sister named
Susan, a baby-brother named Charlie, and a doll named
Anna Maria.</p>

<p>One pleasant summer day Susan took the baby in her
arms, Jane took Anna Maria in her arms, and all together,
and all bareheaded, they took a stroll down the wharf. It
was not a safe place for young children; and Susan ought to
have known better than to take them there.</p>

<p>They wandered about, enjoying the cool sea-air, and
pretty soon stood on the very edge of the wharf, looking
down into the water. Just then, by some accident (I don't
know exactly how it happened), Anna Maria slipped out of
Jane's arms, and fell overboard.</p>

<p>Well, this was not so bad as if Jane herself had fallen
over; but it was almost as bad to poor Jane. She burst
into tears, and raised a cry of distress. There was her dear
little Anna Maria in the water, beyond her reach, and she
could do nothing to save her.</p>

<p>Now there happened to be a smart boy, named Tom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Williams, not far off. He heard Jane's outcry, and came
running down the wharf to see what was the matter; and
another bright boy, named Sam Brown, came with him.
The two saw what the trouble was in a moment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/illus051.png" width="319" height="400" alt="The rescue" title="" />
</div>

<p>They lay down on the wharf, and tried to reach Anna
Maria. But it was of no use. Their arms were not long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
enough. Poor Jane's heart sank within her. She cried and
sobbed, and was in more distress than ever.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," said Tom. "Crying's of no use. Wait a
minute: I know how to do it." And off he ran into the old
junk shop. In a moment he came back, bringing a pair of
tongs. "Now I'll show you!" said he. Down he lay again,
with his bare feet sticking up, as you see in the picture,
reached over the side of the wharf, took Anna Maria in the
tongs, just as she was near floating under the wharf, and
placed her, all wet and dripping, in Jane's arms.</p>

<p>How happy the little girl was to get her darling safe back
again! And how thankful she was to Tom, for coming to
the rescue so bravely! Anna Maria soon got over the
effects of her bath: she did not even catch cold.</p>

<p>But I hope that both Jane and Susan will learn a lesson
from her mishap, and not go so near the edge of the wharf
another time.</p>

<h2>THE YOUNG SHEEP-OWNER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> years ago, on the Island of Nantucket, lived a
little boy named Frank Simmons. His grandfather, with
whom he was a great favorite, owned about two hundred
sheep. Many other persons on the island owned sheep at
that time; and there was a broad plain of open ground,
over which all the flocks roamed in common.</p>

<p>Every year, in the month of June, all the sheep were
driven into a large enclosure near a pond, in which they
were washed until their wool was white and clean. This
was the preparation for shearing, or taking off their heavy
coats of wool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Each separate flock was marked by a little cut made in
the ears. The ears of one flock, for instance, were clipped
at the ends; of another, notched at the sides; of another,
marked by a slit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus053.png" width="500" height="344" alt="The pond" title="" />
</div>

<p>This last was the mark which Frank looked for when he
went with his grandfather to catch his sheep. Frank
thought it was cruel to cut the ears so; but, when his grandfather
told him it was the only way by which each owner
could know his own sheep, he was satisfied.</p>

<p>Whenever he caught one, he would lead it along to his
grandfather's pen, where a man was waiting to take it on
his back, and carry it into the pond. After being washed,
the sheep were left to find their own way to the shore,
which they did very quickly.</p>

<p>It took two days to wash all the sheep on the island.
The washing was finished on Saturday. The sheep were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
allowed to rest and dry themselves on Sunday; and on
Monday morning, bright and early, Frank was ready to
start with his grandfather to catch the sheep for the
shearing.</p>

<p>The shearing occupied two days more; and, after their
heavy coats were off, the sheep would feel so smart, that
they would frisk about like young lambs; and some of them
would jump five or six feet up in the air.</p>

<p>During all this time, their poor little lambs had been kept
apart by themselves. They must have felt lonely enough
without their mothers; but, as soon as the shearing was
over, all the sheep and lambs were set at liberty. Such
a bleating and baa-ing as there was! The sheep ran round
for the lambs, and the lambs for their mothers; and away
they skipped over the plains like children at play.</p>

<p>Frank had made himself so useful in catching the sheep,
that his grandfather gave him two sheep and two lambs as a
reward, and put a new mark on them for him. So Frank
became a young sheep-owner, and, the next year, had his
own sheep to catch.</p>

<h2>EMMA'S CHOICE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> young children, Emma, Charles, and Arthur Payson,
had been left to the care of their old grandfather,
through the death of their parents.</p>

<p>Grandpa Payson was not rich: he was a day-laborer, and
had to work hard for the support of a family, which would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
have been large enough without the addition of three
hungry little ones.</p>

<p>But grandpa's heart was large enough to take them all
in; and they proved such good and lovable children, that he
soon became very much attached to them.</p>

<p>Little Emma was his especial favorite; and one December
day he said to her, "What shall I get you, darling, for a
Christmas present? A nice pair of shoes would be just the
thing, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, grandpa! Give me a book&mdash;a book with
pictures in it: that will be better than new shoes. By
going barefoot, I can make my old shoes last me a year
longer."</p>

<p>Well, in the shop where Grandpa Payson bought a beautiful
bound copy of "The Nursery" for his darling, he happened
to mention to the shopkeeper the fact that Emma
had preferred a new book to a new pair of shoes.</p>

<p>An old lady who stood near could not help hearing the
conversation. That evening, while Grandpa Payson, Emma,
and the two boys, were gathered around the table, feasting
their eyes on the new book, there was a knock at the door,
and a package was left, directed to "Miss Emma Payson."</p>

<p>"Dear me! What can it be? I never had a package
left for me before in all my life," cried Emma.</p>

<p>She opened the package, and there found several pairs of
shoes, and a note, telling her to select two pairs that would
fit her, and to send the rest to the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>In the note the old lady wrote: "You must not only fill
your head with knowledge, but keep your feet warm, if you
would preserve your health. If your brothers will go to
Mr. Lane's to-morrow, he will fit them both to new shoes,
a gift from me. A Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year to you all!"</p>

<h2>HELP ONE ANOTHER.</h2>

<div class='story'>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, passing through a
meadow, I saw a sheep much
troubled by flies. Presently I
saw it walk to a small pond
where there were some young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ducks, and stand there quietly.
Soon the ducks took notice of
the flies, and, coming out from
the water, began snapping them
up, as if to punish them for
worrying the poor sheep.</p>

<p>By and by a starling, from a
tree near by, flew down, lighted
on the sheep's back, and helped
in the good work of ridding her
of the flies.</p>

<p>This, thought I, is a clear
case of putting into practice
the golden rule of "Help one
another." Perhaps you will say,
that the ducks and the starling
wanted to make a meal of the
flies; but I like to think that
some less selfish motive was
mingled with their work.</p></div>

<h2>THE FAITHLESS FRIEND.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">My</span> little lamb, in early spring,<br />
Was but a timid, weakly thing:<br />
His old sheep-mother did not own him:<br />
He would, no doubt, have soon been dead,<br />
If I had not some pity shown him,<br />
And seen that he was warmed and fed.<br />
I was the only friend he knew,<br />
And fond of him each day I grew;<br />
And, as I stroked his woolly head,<br />
"Wherever you may be,<br />
I know, my little lamb," I said,<br />
"You will remember me."<br />
<br />
But, when the fields grew green in May,<br />
They sent my little pet away<br />
To pasture, where the brooks were flowing<br />
Through yellow beds of cowslip flowers,<br />
Where purple violets were growing,<br />
And scented blossoms fell in showers<br />
From off the shading chestnut-trees,<br />
And daisies nodded in the breeze:<br />
And many mates my lambkin found,<br />
As young and gay as he,<br />
And all day long they frisked around<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>And gambolled full of glee.<br />
<br />
But when the robin-redbreasts flew,<br />
And loud and shrill the north-winds blew,<br />
Back from the pastures hard and frozen,<br />
Through winter in the barn to keep,<br />
The little lamb that I had chosen<br />
They brought with all the other sheep;<br />
And, oh! how glad my face to see,<br />
I thought, my pretty pet will be!<br />
But when to meet him I went out,<br />
And tried to coax and call,<br />
He drew away, and turned about,<br />
And would not come at all.<br />
<br />
With his white fleece and playful ways,<br />
My lamb now all about me praise;<br />
But dearer far to me the sickly,<br />
Poor, shivering thing he used to be;<br />
When to my call he came so quickly<br />
I thought that he was fond of me!<br />
But if I pet him now, I know<br />
He'll take my gifts, and off he'll go;<br />
For I, to my regret, have found<br />
I can no more depend<br />
On one who will go frisking round,<br />
And quite forget a friend.<br />

<h2>BILLY AND THE PIG.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is another story about my father's wise old horse,
Billy.</p>

<p>One day, when my father wished to go away to the mill,
he sent my brother Robert down to the pasture to catch
Billy. Robert brought the horse up to the house, tied him
to the fence in the backyard, and gave him some oats in a
pail.</p>

<p>In a pen back of the house we kept three pigs: two of
them were white; and the other was spotted,&mdash;black and
white. These pigs had got out of the pen by pushing off
a board from one side of it.</p>

<p>Soon after Billy began to eat his dinner, the two white
pigs came running through the yard. They saw Billy
eating his oats; and, thinking it would be nice for them to
have some as well as he, they ran up to his pail, and without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as much as saying, "By your leave," began to help
themselves.</p>

<p>Billy had no idea of sharing his dinner with such company
as this: so he lopped back his ears, looked as cross as he
possibly could, snapped at the pigs fiercely with his teeth,
raised his hind-feet from the ground, as if to kick them, and
at last succeeded in frightening them away.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they left the yard, however, before the
spotted pig got his eye upon the pail of oats; and he at
once ran for it with all his might.</p>

<p>Billy tried to scare him as he had the others; but Spotty
was not so easily frightened. He took no notice of any
thing but the oats.</p>

<p>Finding that threats were of no use, Billy seized him by
the back of the neck, raised him about two feet from the
ground, shook him a little, and then let him drop.</p>

<p>Spotty was satisfied. He lost his appetite for oats, and
ran squealing out of the yard.</p>

<h2>JOCKO, THE RAVEN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> raven is a sly bird, and has not many friends. He
will steal from you, if he can. He can crow like a cock,
mew like a cat, and bark like a dog; and sometimes he will
imitate the sound of the rattle with which the farmer tries
to frighten him away from the corn.</p>

<p>The raven, like the parrot, can learn to talk a little. He
is even capable of learning a little Latin. Dr. J. Franklin's
raven, which was named Jocko, pronounced the word <i>aqua</i>
(water) distinctly; but he much preferred wine to water.
Sad to say, Jocko was a toper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"One day," says the doctor, "my housekeeper placed
a glass of red wine on the table: in an instant the bird
plunged in his beak, and began sucking up the wine, drop
by drop. The housekeeper, fearing he would break the
glass, took it away; but at this Jocko was very angry, and
tried to peck at her face.</p>

<p>"If three glasses are placed on the table,&mdash;one of water,
another of beer, and the third of wine,&mdash;Jocko will leave
the first two, and will pay his respects only to the glass of

<p>The raven has a strong memory, great prudence, and
some capacity for reasoning. The keen watchfulness with
which he will regard a man armed with a gun has often
been noticed.</p>

<p>A traveller in the arctic regions relates that he once saw
some ravens outwit a dog. While the dog was at his dinner,
they would make him angry, and entice him away in pursuit
of them; and, when they had led him some distance,
they would fly quickly back, and snatch up the best bones,
before he could prevent it.</p>

<p>That was hardly honest, was it? The raven, you see,
does not set a good example. He drinks wine, he fights,
and he steals. But I suppose he knows no better, and has
not been taught, like you and me, that to do such things is
very wrong.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
